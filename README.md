# Reusable preprocessor directives for GSC

## What is this?

This is a collection of useful preprocessor directives that can be used by gsc-tool, Plutonium clients and XLabs clients.
It is also possible to use gsc-tool to expand these macros and produce a gsc file that is readable by older GSC compilers that do not have a preprocessor.
